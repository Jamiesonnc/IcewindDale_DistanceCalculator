# IcewindDale_DistanceCalculator

I made a distance calculator app to help me figure distances between the towns on the fly.

A few notes:

    These are not the RAW distances or travel times

    All of these travel times and distances are taken from this page: https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45138/roleplaying-games/icewind-dale-travel-times

    The tracker includes an "undead mount" option as i intend to make the sled dogs in chapter 4 undead. (this allows them to ignore rests/exhaustion)

    The times listed INCLUDE the rests for the dogs and axe beaks

    the resting option refers to the mounts not the players
